// TODO: I really want to demonstrate that there can be this engine intro thing that
// is this standard facility that if any app using the engine wants to use, then they can.

// the way this should work is where the app is sort of in full control of how the stuff works.
// and it just leverages these utility AE functions to get the intro done.

// again, the platform layer should know nothing about stb_image and .WAV files. yknow what I'm saying?

// TODO: Also while we are at it, we need to fix the colors on the intro sequence.
// TODO: I'd be down to pay gavin a flat free to make me some sick audio for the engine intro.
// TODO: then maybe I spend some more time doing the art :) Or I pay someone else to get that done.
// TODO: think about the privacy and the legal side of this.
